                            Brief overview:</br> Our team aimed to identify different bird species by performing Fourier Transforms (FT) on bird song audios
                            by comparing the birds' dominant, minumum, maximum and average frequency.
                            The frequency data that we were able to extract from the bird songs was not extensive enough to 
                            consistently identify birds. Our database of birdsongs can be extended and refined in the future to overcome the complications and accquire more reliable data. 
                            A Principle Component Analysis (PCA) can be a potential method for identifying bird species by vocalisation in the future.
                        </br>Python and Jupyter Notebooks are used throughout the project, collaborating our works using CoCalc. You can see the final report by

                                    Brief Introduction to the Wolfram Physics Project (WPP): </br>
                                    Since Sir Issac Newton developed the foundations of mathematical physics, mathematics has been used extensively to model natural phenomenon. To investigate
                                    what nature does, equations have to be derived and solved, and so the fundamentals of physics are described using mathematics. The WPP implements a unique 
                                    approach to discover and explain the fundamental theory of physics in terms of graphs, hypergraphs, rules and computations, while conforming with modern mathematics. 
                                    A very important principle to bear in mind is that <u>simple rules produces complex behaviours</u>. 
                                    For example, 
                                    cellular automaton has shown to demonstrate phase transistion behaviours in the 2D Ising Model (<a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-7--the-ising-model/">see link</a>), which closely relates to my project. My aim was to 
                                    find a rule that generates similar phase transistion behaviours, but in a 3-colored case.
                                    </br></br>
                                    For more information about WPP, this piece of writing from the CEO of Wolfram Research, <a href="https://www.stephenwolfram.com/">Dr. Stephen Wolfram</a>, which I think summaries the WPP very well: <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/09/even-beyond-physics-introducing-multicomputation-as-a-fourth-general-paradigm-for-theoretical-science/">Even beyond Physics: Introducing Multicomputation as a Fourth General Paradigm for Theoretical Science</a>
                                </br></br>
                                    Abstract: </br>Consider a collection of cells with a certain fraction of 3 distinct colours. It is hypothesised that some rule, of which when applied to the system, will turn all the cells to the majority colour when that fraction of the colours exceeds a certain threshold, reaching global consensus. The system will also exhibit indeterminate states when there are equal weights ofcolors, or ”phase transitions”. 
                                    A general majority rule has been hypothesised and studied using grid cellular automata and Mathematica, in cases of 2 and 3 colors.

                                        Brief overview: </br>
                                        In a team of 9, we used machine learning (ML) techniques to predict stock market trends. 
                                        In the beginning, I had a crash course in Machine Learning by trying to predict house prices. I then wrote a literature review 
                                        on ML implemented in stock markets to gain more insights about the problem by researching on recent findings and techniques regarding ML.
                                        In the process, I have learnt the concepts of different ML methods, such as Support-Vector Machines and Recursive Neural Networks. 
                                        My team and I assisted in collecting data from some well known APIs. We also implemented pre-trained Natural Language Processing (NLP) models as a part of our training data.
                                        Python and Jupyter Notebooks are used throughout the project.
