                                Project Brief:</br> 
                                Since the 1980s, it has been speculated that quantum computers can be used to simulate
                                systems, solving physics and chemistry problems. With the impressive works in recent
                                years, theoretical, computational and experimental techniques have been developed, all in
                                the hopes of reaching quantum “supremacy”. Still, there are engineering and theoretical
                                challenges in building a scalable fault tolerant quantum computer, as quantum states in its
                                processors are vulnerable to noises and decoherence. Error correction codes can help protecting information loss and performing error-free computation, with the toric code as the most
                                well-known examples. Being robust to perturbations, the toric code is a 2D topologically
                                ordered quantum matter. We extend this idea to another type of exotic phases of matter,
                                known as time crystals. First proposed by Frank Wilczek, time crystals are periodically
                                driven systems which break continuous time symmetry rather than translational symmetry
                                in classical cases. Forming a dynamical phase of matter, time crystals are protected
                                via many-body localisation. Recent works have shown that there exist topological time
                                crystals. We hypothesise that error correcting codes can be realised in such exotic
                                systems which could be used for error correction. Moreover, quantum memory encoded in
                                the system may be preserved via topological protection and many-body localisation. This
                                work will introduce a novel solution to fault tolerant quantum computation and information processing. This has a huge implications in the quantum technology industry, as these
                                fault tolerant quantum computers will help solve many problems much more efficiently that
                                classical ones, such as optimisation problems, quantum machine learning, quantum
                                chemistry, drug discovery many-body physics problems. </br> </br>

                            Abstract:</br> 
                            It is long thought that Landau’s symmetry-breaking theory can help classify all
                            phases of matter. However, this theory is incomplete. Quantum topological phases
                            of matter are phases of matter which cannot be classified using this spontaneous
                            symmetry-breaking theory, and are robust against perturbations. They have great
                            significance in quantum technologies. Mathematical objects known as tensor networks
                            can help us classify these phases of quantum matter. In this review, we discuss the
                            ideas surrounding topological matter and tensor networks by providing analogies and
                            examples. We focus on how tensor network methods can be used to classify topological
                            phases of matter. Its significance in quantum technologies and the uses of tensor
                            network beyond classification are discussed. The potential future works are identified
                            and outlooks of the subject are given. The reference section at the end gives a list of
                            literature for further reading.</br></br>

                            Abstract:</br> A 1D S=1/2 spin chain with alternating FM and AFM couplings is investigated in the limit of small
                            magnetic anisotropy. The model is treated in terms of a simple nearest-neighbour hamiltonian, then performing a Jordan-Wigner 
                            transformation to map the spin 1/2 operators to spinless fermions. 
                            In the regime of strong anisotropy (XY case), fermions will be non-interacting and is exactly solvable. The model will be equivalent to
                            a Haldane spin chain, exhibiting topological order, hence will be stable against small perturbations.
                            Interactions of the studied regime is treated in a mean-field approximation, requiring to solve
                            coupled self-consistency equations numerically using Python and Mathematica. 
                            The topological phase boundary is determined numerically using a bisection method as a function of the relative strength of the exchange coupling and the magnetic exchange anisotropy.

                                    Brief Introduction to the Wolfram Physics Project (WPP): </br>
                                    Since Sir Issac Newton developed the foundations of mathematical physics, mathematics has been used extensively to model natural phenomenon. To investigate
                                    what nature does, equations have to be derived and solved, and so the fundamentals of physics are described using mathematics. The WPP implements a unique 
                                    approach to discover and explain the fundamental theory of physics in terms of graphs, hypergraphs, rules and computations, while conforming with modern mathematics. 
                                    A very important principle to bear in mind is that <u>simple rules produce complex behaviours</u>. 
                                    For example, 
                                    cellular automaton has shown to demonstrate phase transition behaviours in the 2D Ising Model (<a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-7--the-ising-model/">see link</a>), which closely relates to my project. My aim was to 
                                    find a rule that generates similar phase transistion behaviours, but in a 3-colored case.
                                    </br></br>

                                    Abstract: </br>Consider a collection of cells with a certain fraction of 3 distinct colours. It is hypothesised that some rule, of which when applied to the system, will turn all the cells to the majority colour when that fraction of the colours exceeds a certain threshold, reaching global consensus. The system will also exhibit indeterminate states when there are equal weights of colors, or ”phase transitions”. 
                                    A general majority rule has been hypothesised and studied using grid cellular automata and Mathematica, in cases of 2 and 3 colors.
