                            Project brief:</br> 
                            Spontaneous symmetry breaking has been used to classify conventional phases of matter. Phase transitions are caused by symmetry changes. However, there is a new state of quantum matter which cannot be characterised using symmetry breaking. This kind of quantum matter exhibits topological order, such as the fractional Quantum Hall effect and the Haldane integer spin chain model. Their topological orders are preserved under some perturbations. It has been found that Tensor Networks (TNs) are effective tools in describing, computing, realising and characterising these kinds of different topological phases. TNs are mathematical objects which are used to represent entangled many-body complex quantum systems, and is an area of active interdisciplinary research. This review aims to address how different topological phases of quantum matter are classified using TNs. The review will start with introducing the concept of topology classically and its analogy with topological order in quantum matter. Then, commonly used TNs, such as Matrix Product States (MPS) and the Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) will be discussed. Next, the review will go into how TN methods characterise topological ordered states, while focusing on symmetry protected topological order (SPT). Finally, the review will bring up the implications and uses of TNs and topological quantum matter in quantum information and technologies.

                            Abstract:</br> A 1D S=1/2 spin chain with alternating FM and AFM couplings is investigated in the limit of small
                            magnetic anisotropy. The model is treated in terms of a simple nearest-neighbour hamiltonian, then performing a Jordan-Wigner 
                            transformation to map the spin 1/2 operators to spinless fermions. 
                            In the regime of strong anisotropy (XY case), fermions will be non-interacting and is exactly solvable. The model will be equivalent to
                            a Haldane spin chain, exhibiting topological order, hence will be stable against small perturbations.
                            Interactions of the studied regime is treated in a mean-field approximation, requiring to solve
                            coupled self-consistency equations numerically using Python and Mathematica. 
                            The topological phase boundary is determined numerically using a bisection method as a function of the relative strength of the exchange coupling and the magnetic exchange anisotropy.

                                    Brief Introduction to the Wolfram Physics Project (WPP): </br>
                                    Since Sir Issac Newton developed the foundations of mathematical physics, mathematics has been used extensively to model natural phenomenon. To investigate
                                    what nature does, equations have to be derived and solved, and so the fundamentals of physics are described using mathematics. The WPP implements a unique 
                                    approach to discover and explain the fundamental theory of physics in terms of graphs, hypergraphs, rules and computations, while conforming with modern mathematics. 
                                    A very important principle to bear in mind is that <u>simple rules produce complex behaviours</u>. 
                                    For example, 
                                    cellular automaton has shown to demonstrate phase transition behaviours in the 2D Ising Model (<a href="https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/notes-7-7--the-ising-model/">see link</a>), which closely relates to my project. My aim was to 
                                    find a rule that generates similar phase transistion behaviours, but in a 3-colored case.
                                    </br></br>

                                    Abstract: </br>Consider a collection of cells with a certain fraction of 3 distinct colours. It is hypothesised that some rule, of which when applied to the system, will turn all the cells to the majority colour when that fraction of the colours exceeds a certain threshold, reaching global consensus. The system will also exhibit indeterminate states when there are equal weights of colors, or ”phase transitions”. 
                                    A general majority rule has been hypothesised and studied using grid cellular automata and Mathematica, in cases of 2 and 3 colors.
